# basic_design_system

This project is an effort to create a standard, basic, boilerplate design system in vanilla CSS that can be reused easily without concern for installing dependencies. This project, aptly named: "Basic Design System,"
is just that, a basic modular design system with reusable elements consisting of buttons, colors, spacing, shadows, animations, and typography.
